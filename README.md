## Board usage

If you like to implement a story that lies in the backlog set its status to "Selected for development". In the board you can add subtasks that contain the actual work for the story. Please pay attention that the sub tasks must be set to "Selected for development" manually.

## Branching strategy

Please create a new branch for each user story you like to implement. Name the branch as follows: If the story has the issue number 1 and the title "Create game" then the branch should be called "1_create_game".
